## Step 5: Exploring the Environment

With the provisioning complete, let's verify that it actually worked as expected.

1. Connect to the NX-OS device via CLI with `vagrant ssh`. Notice the hostname prompt is indeed `nxos1#` now instead of the box default of `n9kv1` seen in previous examples.

    ```bash
    (venv) [root@devbox lab03]# vagrant ssh

    Bad terminal type: "xterm-256color". Will assume vt100.

    ```

1. Check the IP interface configuration with `show ip int bri` to see that indeed 4 loopbacks and Ethernet1/1 have been configured.

    ```
    nxos1# show ip int bri

    IP Interface Status for VRF "default"(1)
    Interface            IP Address      Interface Status

    Connection to 127.0.0.1 closed.
