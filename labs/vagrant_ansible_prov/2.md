## Step 2: Adding Ansible Provisioning to the Vagrantfile

1. You should have already cloned down the code sample repository for these labs in the previous learning labs, but if you happened to skip that lab, here are the steps again.  

    ```bash
    [root@devbox box_building]# cd ~
    [root@devbox ~]# cd coding/
    [root@devbox coding]# git clone https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/learning_lab_vagrant_netprog_code

    Cloning into 'learning_lab_vagrant_netprog_code'...
    remote: Counting objects: 3, done.
    remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 3 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
    Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.

    [root@devbox coding]# cd learning_lab_vagrant_netprog_code/

    [root@devbox learning_lab_vagrant_netprog_code]# ls
    lab01  lab02  lab03  README.md
    ```

1. Enter the `lab03` directory.  

    ```bash
    [root@devbox learning_lab_vagrant_netprog_code]# cd lab03
    ```

1. In order for Vagrant to call Ansible for provisioning, it needs to be installed on our workstation.  Ansible is a Python application, and therefore you will use typical Python practices to set it up.  

    1. Create and activate a Python 3 Virtual Environment.  

        ```bash
        [root@devbox lab03]# virtualenv venv --python=python3.6
        Running virtualenv with interpreter /usr/bin/python3.6
        Using base prefix '/usr'
        New python executable in /root/coding/learning_lab_vagrant_netprog_code/lab03/venv/bin/python3.6
        Also creating executable in /root/coding/learning_lab_vagrant_netprog_code/lab03/venv/bin/python
        Installing setuptools, pip, wheel...done.

        [root@devbox lab03]# source venv/bin/activate
        (venv) [root@devbox lab03]#
        ```

    1. Install Ansible using the included `requirements.txt` file.  

        ```bash
        (venv) [root@devbox lab03]# pip install -r requirements.txt
        Collecting ansible==2.4.3.0 (from -r requirements.txt (line 1))
        .
        .

        (venv) [root@devbox lab03]# ansible --version
        ansible 2.4.3.0
          config file = None
          configured module search path = ['/root/.ansible/plugins/modules', '/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
          ansible python module location = /root/coding/learning_lab_vagrant_netprog_code/lab03/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/ansible
          executable location = /root/coding/learning_lab_vagrant_netprog_code/lab03/venv/bin/ansible
          python version = 3.6.4 (default, Dec 19 2017, 14:48:12) [GCC 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-16)]
        ```

1. Open the Vagrantfile with vim to view it's contents.  If you are unfamiliar with vim that is fine.  We are leveraging it simply to view the file with color syntax highlighting.  (Though the syntax highlighting is missing from the learning lab view below.)

    ```bash
    [root@devbox lab03]# vim Vagrantfile
    ```

    1. Navigate up and down the file within vim by using the `j` key to move down a line, and `k` key to move up a line.  Quit and exit vim by pressing the `:` key and enter `q!` followed by pressing **Enter**.  

1. This Vagrantfile does not include any of the default comments that you saw in the previous exercises, but rather only has the active configuration and relevant comments.  

    ```ruby
    # -*- mode: ruby -*-
    # vi: set ft=ruby :

    Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
        config.vm.define "nxos1" do |node|
            node.vm.box =  "nxos/7.0.3.I7.3"

            # Statically set the SSH and HTTP ports
            config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 22, host: 2222, id: 'ssh', auto_correct: true
            config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 80, host: 2224, id: 'http'
        end

        config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
          # Customize the amount of memory on the VM:
          vb.memory = "4096"
          vb.customize ['modifyvm', :id, '--uart1', '0x3F8', 4, '--uartmode1', 'disconnected']
          vb.customize ['modifyvm', :id, '--uart2', '0x2F8', 3, '--uartmode2', 'disconnected']
        end

        # Setup Ansible Provisioning
        config.vm.provision "ansible" do |ansible|
          ansible.playbook = "ansible_provision.yaml"
          ansible.inventory_path = "./hosts"
          ansible.raw_arguments = ["--connection=paramiko"]
        end
    end
    ```

    1. The SSH port mapping has been explicitly set to port `2222` to ensure it stays on the expected port for the Ansible execution.  
    1. A new configuration block that starts with `config.vm.provision "ansible" do |ansible|` is used to provide the key details to Vagrant:  
        * What playbook to run (`ansible.playbook = "ansible_provision.yaml"`)  
        * The inventory file to use (`ansible.inventory_path = "./hosts"`)
        * Ensuring the Paramiko library used for SSH connections (`ansible.raw_arguments = ["--connection=paramiko"]`).  *Not necessarily required but has been found to provide better results*
