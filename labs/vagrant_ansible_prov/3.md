## Step 3: Ansible Inventory and Playbooks with Vagrant

Before we startup the environment, let's explore the Ansible setup that is being used.

1. Take a look at the contents of the inventory file with `cat hosts`

    ```bash
    (venv) [root@devbox lab03]# cat hosts

    [all:vars]
    ansible_python_interpreter="/usr/bin/env python"

    [vagrant]
    nxos1
    ```

    * The global variable `ansible_python_interpreter` is set to ensure that Ansible leverages the active Python interpreter in the environment. This overrides the default behavior of using the default system Python interpreter. This setting provides a more stable and consistent experience.
    * There is a group called `vagrant` that has a single host of `nxos1`. Part of the integration of Ansible with Vagrant is that the Vagrant hostname can be used within Ansible rather than using an IP address, which would be 127.0.0.1 with Vagrant.

1. Now open the playbook with vim to view its contents. If you are unfamiliar with vim that is fine. We are leveraging it to view the file with color syntax highlighting. (Though the syntax highlighting is missing from the web-based view below.)

    ```bash
    [root@devbox lab03]# vim ansible_provision.yaml
    ```

    * Navigate up and down the file within vim by using the `j` key to move down a line, and `k` key to move up a line. Quit and exit vim by pressing the `:` key and enter `q!` followed by pressing **Enter**.

        ```yaml
        - name: Provision NX-OS Devices
          hosts: vagrant
          connection: local
          gather_facts: false

          tasks:
            - name: Pause to complete boot
              pause:
                seconds: 5

            - name: Enable NX-API
              nxos_feature:
                provider: "{{provider_ssh}}"
                feature: nxapi
                state: enabled

            - name: Configure System Settings
              nxos_system:
                provider: "{{provider_nxapi}}"
                hostname: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"

            - name: Configure Interfaces
              with_items: "{{ interfaces }}"
              nxos_interface:
                provider: "{{provider_nxapi}}"
                interface: "{{ item.name }}"
                mode: layer3
                description: "{{ item.desc }}"
                admin_state: up

            - name: Configure IPv4 Address on Interface
              with_items: "{{ interfaces }}"
              nxos_ip_interface:
                provider: "{{provider_nxapi}}"
                interface: "{{ item.name }}"
                version: v4
                addr: "{{ item.ip_address }}"
                mask: "{{ item.prefix }}"
        ```

    1. The playbook runs against all hosts in the group `vagrant`. This allows the playbook to support single or multi-node topologies.
    1. There is a single play called "Provision NX-OS Devices" that contains five tasks.
    1. After waiting five seconds to ensure the NX-OS device is fully started (just because VirtualBox reports the VM has started doesn't mean that NX-OS has started), the provisioning begins using a set of [NX-OS Modules for Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/list_of_network_modules.html#nxos).
    1. Throughout the playbook variable references are used (indicated by Jinja2 double curly brace indication - for example, `"{{ interfaces }}"`).

1. Now open the source of the variables, `host_vars/nxos1.yaml`, with vim to view its contents. If you are unfamiliar with vim that is fine. We are leveraging it simply to view the file with color syntax highlighting. (Though the syntax highlighting is missing from the web-based view below.)

    ```bash
    [root@devbox lab03]# vim host_vars/nxos1.yaml
    ```

    * Navigate up and down the file within vim by using the `j` key to move down a line, and `k` key to move up a line. Quit and exit vim by pressing the `:` key and enter `q!` followed by pressing **Enter**.

    ```yaml
    # Connection details for SSH/CLI Access
    provider_ssh:
      host: 127.0.0.1
      port: 2222
      username: vagrant
      password: vagrant
      transport: cli
    # Connection details for NX-API Access
    provider_nxapi:
      host: 127.0.0.1
      port: 2224
      username: vagrant
      password: vagrant
      transport: nxapi

    interfaces:
        - name: Loopback11
          desc: Sample Network Route Injection
          ip_address: 172.21.1.1
          prefix: 24
        - name: Loopback12
          desc: Sample Network Route Injection
          ip_address: 172.21.2.1
          prefix: 24
        - name: Loopback13
          desc: Sample Network Route Injection
          ip_address: 172.21.3.1
          prefix: 24
        - name: Loopback14
          desc: Sample Network Route Injection
          ip_address: 172.21.4.1
          prefix: 24
        - name: Ethernet1/1
          desc: Link to other switch
          ip_address: 172.20.0.1
          prefix: 24
    ```    

    1. It is an Ansible standard that you can provide host-specific variables to a playbook by creating a YAML file named after the host and placing it into the `host_vars` directory.
    1. Two variables, `provider_ssh` and `provider_nxapi` include the connection details used to access the NX-OS device over SSH and NX-API respectively.
    1. The variable `interfaces` is a list of interfaces which use key/value pairs to provide the configuration information used to configure a series of loopback and Ethernet interfaces.
