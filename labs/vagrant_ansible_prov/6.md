## Step 6: Destroying the Environment

1. Cleanup after the lab by destroying the environment with `vagrant destroy`. 

    ```bash
    (venv) [root@devbox lab03]# vagrant destroy
        nxos1: Are you sure you want to destroy the 'nxos1' VM? [y/N] y
    ==> nxos1: Forcing shutdown of VM...
    ==> nxos1: Destroying VM and associated drives...
    ```
