## Step 2: Vagrant Commands

Now that you have a basic understanding of what Vagrant is and its purpose, let's explore it.

1. Start by opening your terminal and creating a new folder for our exploration.

    ```bash
    [root@devbox ~]# mkdir -p coding/vagrant_explore
    [root@devbox ~]# cd coding/vagrant_explore/
    [root@devbox vagrant_explore]#
    ```

1. Use `vagrant init <box_name>` to create a new Vagrantfile in the directory that provides the details for our new environment.
    * ***Note: hashicorp/precise64 is a basic Ubuntu 12.04 (32 and 64-bit) box that is provided by HashiCorp and available for minimal use cases.***

    ```bash
    [root@devbox vagrant_explore]# vagrant init hashicorp/precise64
    ```

1. Use `vagrant up` to start the new environment.

    ```bash
    [root@devbox vagrant_explore]# vagrant up

    # Output

    ==> default: Box 'hashicorp/precise64' could not be found. Attempting to find and install...

    ==> default: Setting the name of the VM: vagrant_explore_default_1518539565932_76183

        default:
        default: Vagrant insecure key detected. Vagrant will automatically replace
        default: this with a newly generated keypair for better security.
        default:
        default: Inserting generated public key within guest...
        default: Removing insecure key from the guest if it's present...

    ==> default: Machine booted and ready!
    ==> default: Checking for guest additions in VM...
        default: The guest additions on this VM do not match the installed version of
        default: VirtualBox! In most cases this is fine, but in rare cases it can
        default: prevent things such as shared folders from working properly. If you see
        default: shared folder errors, please make sure the guest additions within the
        default: virtual machine match the version of VirtualBox you have installed on
        default: your host and reload your VM.
        default:
        default: Guest Additions Version: 4.2.0
        default: VirtualBox Version: 5.1
    ==> default: Mounting shared folders...
        default: /vagrant => /root/coding/vagrant_explore
    ```

1. You can connect to your new environment with `vagrant ssh`. This logs you into the VM that was instantiated with Virtualbox. Type `exit` to log out from the VM and return to your local terminal.

    ```bash
    [root@devbox vagrant_explore]# vagrant ssh
    Welcome to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.2.0-23-generic x86_64)

     * Documentation:  https://help.ubuntu.com/
    New release '14.04.5 LTS' available.
    Run 'do-release-upgrade' to upgrade to it.

    Welcome to your Vagrant-built virtual machine.
    Last login: Fri Sep 14 06:23:18 2012 from 10.0.2.2
    vagrant@precise64:~$
    vagrant@precise64:~$ pwd
    /home/vagrant
    vagrant@precise64:~$ exit
    logout
    Connection to 127.0.0.1 closed.
    [root@devbox vagrant_explore]#
    ```

1. Several commands exist to manage the state of the environment. Follow along here to see how to `suspend`, `resume`, `halt`, `reload`, and `destroy` the environment.

    ```bash
    # vagrant suspend pauses the VM in its current state
    [root@devbox vagrant_explore]# vagrant suspend
    ==> default: Saving VM state and suspending execution...

    # vagrant resume will re-start a paused VM.
    # vagrant up would also resume a suspended VM
    [root@devbox vagrant_explore]# vagrant resume

    ==> default: Resuming suspended VM...
    ==> default: Booting VM...
    ==> default: Waiting for machine to boot. This may take a few minutes...
        default: SSH address: 127.0.0.1:2222
        default: SSH username: vagrant
        default: SSH auth method: private key
    ==> default: Machine booted and ready!
    ==> default: Machine already provisioned. Run `vagrant provision` or use the `--provision`
    ==> default: flag to force provisioning. Provisioners marked to run always will still run.

    # vagrant halt will shutdown a VM
    [root@devbox vagrant_explore]# vagrant halt
    ==> default: Attempting graceful shutdown of VM...

    # vagrant restarts a VM loads a new Vagrantfile configuration
    [root@devbox vagrant_explore]# vagrant reload
    ==> default: Checking if box 'hashicorp/precise64' is up to date...
    ==> default: Clearing any previously set forwarded ports...
    ==> default: Clearing any previously set network interfaces...
    ==> default: Preparing network interfaces based on configuration...
        default: Adapter 1: nat
    ==> default: Forwarding ports...
        default: 22 (guest) => 2222 (host) (adapter 1)
    ==> default: Booting VM...
    ==> default: Waiting for machine to boot. This may take a few minutes...
        default: SSH address: 127.0.0.1:2222
        default: SSH username: vagrant
        default: SSH auth method: private key
    ==> default: Machine booted and ready!
    ==> default: Checking for guest additions in VM...
        default: The guest additions on this VM do not match the installed version of
        default: VirtualBox! In most cases this is fine, but in rare cases it can
        default: prevent things such as shared folders from working properly. If you see
        default: shared folder errors, please make sure the guest additions within the
        default: virtual machine match the version of VirtualBox you have installed on
        default: your host and reload your VM.
        default:
        default: Guest Additions Version: 4.2.0
        default: VirtualBox Version: 5.1
    ==> default: Mounting shared folders...
        default: /vagrant => /root/coding/vagrant_explore
    ==> default: Machine already provisioned. Run `vagrant provision` or use the `--provision`
    ==> default: flag to force provisioning. Provisioners marked to run always will still run.

    # vagrant destroy deletes the running environment
    [root@devbox vagrant_explore]# vagrant destroy
        default: Are you sure you want to destroy the 'default' VM? [y/N] y
    ==> default: Forcing shutdown of VM...
    ==> default: Destroying VM and associated drives...
    ```

1. If you want to see the status of your environment, `vagrant status` shows you.

    ```bash
    [root@devbox vagrant_explore]# vagrant status
    Current machine states:

    default                   not created (virtualbox)

    The environment has not yet been created. Run `vagrant up` to
    create the environment. If a machine is not created, only the
    default provider will be shown. So if a provider is not listed,
    then the machine is not created for that environment.
    ```

    1. If you would like to see all currently created environments, `vagrant global-status` is handy. To target a particular machine with a command, simply provide the id following the command as in `vagrant destroy 1a2b3c4d`.

        ```bash
        [root@devbox vagrant_explore]# vagrant global-status
        id       name    provider   state   directory
        ------------------------------------------------------------------------
        45fac29  default virtualbox running /root/coding/vagrant_explore

        The above shows information about all known Vagrant environments
        on this machine. This data is cached and may not be completely
        up-to-date. To interact with any of the machines, you can go to
        that directory and run Vagrant, or you can use the ID directly
        with Vagrant commands from any directory. For example:
        "vagrant destroy 1a2b3c4d"    
        ```

1. To view the list of boxes that are in your local inventory use `vagrant box list`.

    ```bash
    [root@devbox vagrant_explore]# vagrant box list
    hashicorp/precise64 (virtualbox, 1.1.0)
    ```
