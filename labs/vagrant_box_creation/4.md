## Optional Step: Adding the Box to Vagrant's Inventory

When the script completes, you have a Vagrant Box that is configured and ready to provide the foundation for network programmability experiments. However, you still need to add it to the Vagrant inventory on your local workstation. The script ends with the details on how to continue.

1. Use `vagrant box add` to add the box to your inventory.

    ```bash
    (venv) [root@devbox box_building]# vagrant box add --name nxos/7.0.3.I6.1 /root/coding/vagrant_net_prog/box_building/created_boxes/nxos_7.0.3.I6.1/nxos_7.0.3.I6.1.box --force
    ==> box: Box file was not detected as metadata. Adding it directly...
    ==> box: Adding box 'nxos/7.0.3.I6.1' (v0) for provider:
        box: Unpacking necessary files from: file:///root/coding/vagrant_net_prog/box_building/created_boxes/nxos_7.0.3.I6.1/nxos_7.0.3.I6.1.box
    ==> box: Successfully added box 'nxos/7.0.3.I6.1' (v0) for 'virtualbox'!
    ```

1. Verify it was added successfully with `vagrant box list`.

    ```bash
    (venv) [root@devbox box_building]# vagrant box list
    hashicorp/precise64 (virtualbox, 1.1.0)
    nxos/7.0.3.I6.1     (virtualbox, 0)
    ```

> Reminder: When we downloaded the box for Open NX-OS 7.0(3)I7(3) (or later) we didn't need to run the customization script and can simply add the downloaded box from CCO to your inventory directly.  This would be with a a command such as `vagrant box add nxos/7.0.3.I7.3 ~/Downloads/nxosv-final.7.0.3.I7.3.box --force`.
