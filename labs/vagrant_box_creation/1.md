# Creating Cisco Network Device Vagrant Boxes

Before you can do your first `vagrant up` on a switch or router environment, you need to have the Vagrant box to act as the template. In this lab we'll look at how you can generate boxes for IOS XE, Open NX-OS, and IOS XR leveraging resources available for download by Cisco.

> Note: Some of the downloads require your CCO account to have the proper entitlements and service contracts associated to your account. If you lack the entitlement for one of the downloads, please contact your Cisco Partner or Account team to ensure you have the correct service contracts associated to your CCO account.

## Objectives

The objective of this lab is to:

* Locate and leverage available resources for creating Vagrant boxes
* Create a Vagrant Box for an Open NX-OS Device

## Prerequisites

To complete this lab you need a development workstation with Vagrant and other tools installed.

The recommendation is to leverage the [DevBox DevNet Sandbox](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/f1a51f3b-3377-444d-97f0-5ad300d976be?diagramType=Topology) which has all the pre-requisites installed so you can immediately begin the lab.

As an alternative you can leverage your own workstation for the lab, but you need to follow the steps listed in the ***Setup your own computer*** information at the top of the lab.

### Windows Workstation Note

This lab leverages a script and utility that require either a Linux or OS X workstation to complete successfully. If you are executing this lab on your Windows workstation you need to perform this lab in an alternative environment such as a virtual environment. A great option is to use the [DevBox DevNet Sandbox](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/f1a51f3b-3377-444d-97f0-5ad300d976be?diagramType=Topology) for this lab.

### Using the DevBox Sandbox

1. Reserve an instance of the Sandbox by navigating to the [DevBox DevNet Sandbox](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/f1a51f3b-3377-444d-97f0-5ad300d976be?diagramType=Topology) page. Because some of the labs in this module build upon earlier labs, you should reserve your sandbox for long enough that you'll be able to complete all labs in this module.
1. Once your Sandbox is fully provisioned you'll be sent an email with the VPN credentials to connect to your sandbox. Connect to your environment using either AnyConnect or OpenConnect.
1. You can leverage either SSH or RDP to connect to the DevBox at the address of 10.10.20.20 with credentials of root/cisco123.

### Your Own Workstation

1. Click the link at the top of the page for "Setup your own computer".
1. Follow the setup details to install and configure all the prerequisites needed for the labs in this module.

### Learning Labs to Complete First

It is recommended that you complete the labs in this module in order. Before beginning this lab please complete:

* Vagrant 101

## Environment Clean-Up Check

Before beginning this lab, let's make sure you don't have any Vagrant environments still running from previous labs or steps.

1. Run `vagrant global-status` to view the status of any active environments.

    ```bash
    [root@devbox coding]# vagrant global-status

    id       name    provider   state   directory
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    8d1eaec  default virtualbox saved   /root/coding/learning_lab_vagrant_netprog_code/lab01
    91eae66  default virtualbox running /root/coding/learning_lab_vagrant_netprog_code/lab02
    ```

1. If you have any environments listed as `running`, you should either `suspend` or `destroy` them before continuing. You need to provide the `id` field following the command to indicate which environment you are targeting. For example:

    ```bash
    # To suspend an environment
    [root@devbox coding]# vagrant suspend 91eae66

    # To destroy an environment
    [root@devbox coding]# vagrant destroy 91eae66
    ```

    * *Note: You only need to provide enough characters in the ID field to uniquely identify an environment.*

## Step 1: Obtaining the Vagrant Network Programmability Resources  

To create the Vagrant boxes we use Python scripts that have been developed and made available on GitHub by Cisco engineers and the programmability community.

1. Navigate to [https://github.com/hpreston/vagrant_net_prog](https://github.com/hpreston/vagrant_net_prog). This is a repository created and maintained by Hank Preston, one of the developer evangelists in DevNet, that contains samples and scripts for using Vagrant for network programmability.

    ![](/posts/files/vagrant_box_creation/images/vagrant_net_prog_repo.png)

1. Click on the [box_building](https://github.com/hpreston/vagrant_net_prog/tree/master/box_building) link in the main repo README. This link takes you to the README dedicated to building boxes for Cisco network devices. Read through the document to understand the process that we follow in this lab.

1. Open a terminal and clone the repository from GitHub.

    ```bash
    [root@devbox vagrant_explore]# cd ~
    [root@devbox ~]# cd coding
    [root@devbox coding]# git clone https://github.com/hpreston/vagrant_net_prog

    Cloning into 'vagrant_net_prog'...

    remote: Total 295 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 295
    Receiving objects: 100% (295/295), 354.43 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.
    Resolving deltas: 100% (132/132), done.

    [root@devbox coding]# cd vagrant_net_prog/box_building
    ```

1. If you are using the DevNet Sandbox "DevBox" to complete this lab, you use `yum` to install the `socat` utility. If you are working locally on your own workstation, use the appropriate method to install the software.

    ```bash
    [root@devbox box_building]# yum install -y socat

    # Output truncated
    Running transaction
      Installing : socat-1.7.3.2-2.el7.x86_64                                                                              1/1
      Verifying  : socat-1.7.3.2-2.el7.x86_64                                                                              1/1

    Installed:
      socat.x86_64 0:1.7.3.2-2.el7

    Complete!
    ```

1. Create and activate a Python 2.7.13 Virtual Environment. *The default version of Python on the DevBox is an older version of Python.*

    ```bash
    [root@devbox box_building]# virtualenv venv --python=python2.7

    [root@devbox box_building]# source venv/bin/activate
    ```

1. Install the Python script requirements.

    ```bash
    (venv) [root@devbox box_building]# pip install -r requirements.txt

    Collecting pexpect==4.2.1 (from -r requirements.txt (line 1))
