## Step 3: Building the Box

With the file downloaded, and the conversion script requirements met, now we can create our Vagrant box.

> But wait... didn't we just download a Vagrant Box from Cisco.com?  That is true, however the box image posted to Cisco.com is a bare, unconfigured version of a Nexus 9000 switch. That is, it's in the state any new Nexus 9000 switch is when you take it out of the box. It lacks any configuration and will kick off a POAP process or setup script. This means that before you could connect to a new environment with `vagrant ssh`, or interface via an API, you would need to connect via a serial connection to the VM and complete the setup. Typically if you are using vagrant with a network device, you are not interested in the Day 0 setup, but rather configuration and operation activities. The script that we will run will complete the Day 0 setup of the Nexus 9000v VM, and create a new Box that is immediately ready for use with `vagrant up`.

1. Run the `nxosv_vbox_prep.py` script and provide the location of the downloaded `nxosv-final.7.0.3.I6.1.box` that will be the source image.

    * ***The script takes several minutes to complete, and includes several points where there is no visible activity for up to 5 minutes. Be patient and allow the script to complete.***  

    ```bash
    (venv) [root@devbox box_building]# python nxosv_vbox_prep.py ~/Downloads/nxosv-final.7.0.3.I6.1.box
    ```

1. Here is the full expected output of the script for reference.

    ```bash
    ==> Check whether "socat" is installed
    ==> Failed (1):
    ==> Error [A Vagrant environment or target machine is required to run this
    command. Run `vagrant init` to create a new Vagrant environment. Or,
    get an ID of a target machine from `vagrant global-status` to run
    this command on. A final option is to change to a directory with a
    Vagrantfile and to try again.
    ]
    ==>   Note: An error may occur if the Vagrant environment isn't initialized, not problem
    ==> Creating Vagrantfile
    ==> Starting Vagrant Environment.
    ==>   Note: vagrant may generate an error, that is expected
    ==>   Note: this step may take 3-5 minutes to complete.
    ==> Failed (1):
    ==> Error [Timed out while waiting for the machine to boot. This means that
    Vagrant was unable to communicate with the guest machine within
    the configured ("config.vm.boot_timeout" value) time period.

    If you look above, you should be able to see the error(s) that
    Vagrant had when attempting to connect to the machine. These errors
    are usually good hints as to what may be wrong.

    If you're using a custom box, make sure that networking is properly
    working and you're able to connect to the machine. It is a common
    problem that networking isn't setup properly in these boxes.
    Verify that authentication configurations are also setup properly,
    as well.

    If the box appears to be booting properly, you may want to increase
    the timeout ("config.vm.boot_timeout") value.

    ==> Completed!
    ==>
    ==> Add box to system:
    ==>   vagrant box add --name nxos/7.0.3.I6.1 /root/coding/vagrant_net_prog/box_building/created_boxes/nxos_7.0.3.I6.1/nxos_7.0.3.I6.1.box --force
    ==>
    ==> Use your new box:
    ==> Make project directory:
    ==>   mkdir my_project
    ==>   cd my_project
    ==> Initialize Project Vagrant Environment:
    ==>   vagrant init nxos/7.0.3.I6.1
    ==> Bring up box:
    ==>   vagrant up
    ==>
    ==> Note: Due to a shell error, 'vagrant up' will error the first time launching a box. Run 'vagrant up' to complete
    ==> Note:
    ==>   Both the NX-OS SSH and NX-API username and password is vagrant/vagrant
    ```

#### Next Step: Adding the Box to Vagrant's Inventory
