## Step 2: Downloading Source Artifacts from Cisco

For this lab we build a box for an Open NX-OS switch using a source image that is made available from Cisco without any specific entitlements needed. If your CCO account has access to other source images, you can replicate these steps for the other platforms using the information available in the box building repository.

1. Navigate to the downloads page for the [Nexus 9000v Switch on Cisco.com](https://software.cisco.com/download/release.html?mdfid=286312239&softwareid=282088129).
    * ***Note: If you are completing this lab using the DevNet DevBox Sandbox, you'll need to RDP in and download using a web browser on the workstation. There is no way to download the image via the CLI.***

1. Change to Release 7.0(3)I6(1) in the view. *This release is available to download without entitlement.*

1. Download the **Cisco Nexus 9000/3000 Virtual Switch for Vagrant** `nxosv-final.7.0.3.I6.1.box` file. You need to log into Cisco.com to complete the download.
