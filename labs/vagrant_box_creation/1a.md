## Optional Step: Obtaining Boxes for Other Platforms (IOS XE, IOS XR, NX-OS)

If you'd like to add Vagrant boxes to your inventory for IOS XE, IOS XR, or NX-OS pre-7.0(3)I7(3), follow along in these optional steps.  

> Note: The scripts used in these steps require a workstation running Linux or Mac OS.

To create these Vagrant boxes we will use Python scripts that have been developed and made available on GitHub by Cisco engineers and the programmability community.  

1. Navigate to [https://github.com/hpreston/vagrant_net_prog](https://github.com/hpreston/vagrant_net_prog).  This is a repository created and maintained by [Hank Preston](https://twitter.com/hfpreston), one of the developer evangelists in DevNet, that contains samples and scripts for using Vagrant for network programmability.

1. Click on the [box_building](https://github.com/hpreston/vagrant_net_prog/tree/master/box_building) link in the main repo readme.  This will take you to the README dedicated to building boxes for Cisco network devices.  Read through the document to understand the process that we will be following in this lab.  

1. Open a terminal and clone down the repository from GitHub.  

    ```bash
    [root@devbox vagrant_explore]# cd ~
    [root@devbox ~]# cd coding
    [root@devbox coding]# git clone https://github.com/hpreston/vagrant_net_prog

    Cloning into 'vagrant_net_prog'...

    remote: Total 295 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 295
    Receiving objects: 100% (295/295), 354.43 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.
    Resolving deltas: 100% (132/132), done.

    [root@devbox coding]# cd vagrant_net_prog/box_building
    ```

1. If you are using the DevNet Sandbox "DevBox" to complete this lab, you will use `yum` to install the `socat` utility.  If you are working locally on your own workstation, use the appropriate method to install the software.  (On Mac OS, [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is a great option)

    ```bash
    [root@devbox box_building]# yum install -y socat

    # Output truncated
    Running transaction
      Installing : socat-1.7.3.2-2.el7.x86_64                                                                              1/1
      Verifying  : socat-1.7.3.2-2.el7.x86_64                                                                              1/1

    Installed:
      socat.x86_64 0:1.7.3.2-2.el7

    Complete!
    ```

1. Create and activate a Python 2.7.13 Virtual Environment.  *The default version of Python on the DevBox is an older version of Python.*

    ```bash
    [root@devbox box_building]# virtualenv venv --python=python2.7

    [root@devbox box_building]# source venv/bin/activate
    ```

1. Install the Python script requirements.  

    ```bash
    (venv) [root@devbox box_building]# pip install -r requirements.txt

    Collecting pexpect==4.2.1 (from -r requirements.txt (line 1))
