## Step 4: Exploring the Environment

1. Check the status of your environment with `vagrant status`

    ```bash
    [root@devbox lab01]# vagrant status
    Current machine states:

    default                   running (virtualbox)

    The VM is running. To stop this VM, you can run `vagrant halt` to
    shut it down forcefully, or you can run `vagrant suspend` to simply
    suspend the virtual machine. In either case, to restart it again,
    simply run `vagrant up`.
    ```

1. And use `vagrant port` to view the port mappings that are in place.

    ```bash
    [root@devbox lab01]# vagrant port
    The forwarded ports for the machine are listed below. Please note that
    these values may differ from values configured in the Vagrantfile if the
    provider supports automatic port collision detection and resolution.

        80 (guest) => 2224 (host)
       830 (guest) => 2223 (host)
       443 (guest) => 2225 (host)
        22 (guest) => 2200 (host)
    ```

    * You see that port 80 is indeed mapped to port 2224, but there are others as well.
    * A Vagrant Box can include much more than the VM Template file. It can also include default environment configuration settings that the box creator includes to make the box more easily useful for developers.
    * Part of the Python script that you ran to create the box was some default configurations to ensure the experience with the NX-OS Box was seamless. This includes port mapping for common API interfaces for NX-OS.
        * 80 - 2224 for HTTP/NX-API
        * 443 - 2225 for HTTPS/NX-API/RESTCONF
        * 830 - 2223 for NETCONF
        * Mapping port 22 for SSH access is a default behavior for Vagrant

1. Connect to your NX-OS switch with `vagrant ssh`.

    ```bash
    [root@devbox lab01]# vagrant ssh

    Bad terminal type: "xterm-256color". Will assume vt100.

    ```

1. You are now connected with SSH to the running n9000v switch that was started with `vagrant up`. Let's explore the default configuration that was applied by the creation script.
    1. Run `sh run | inc "username vagrant"` to see that an admin user called "vagrant" with password "vagrant" has been added to the template, along with a well known SSH public key for login.

        ```
        n9kv1# sh run | inc "username vagrant"
        username vagrant password 5 $5$dln.2Cnt$sMKPfdW6r9e7rWfrgxKtZKwpQJ6.aX3MeHc2irjHzNA  role network-admin
        username vagrant sshkey ssh-rsa AAAA...c9WhQ== vagrant insecure public key
        ```

        > Developers have a certain set of expectations about Vagrant boxes, and one of them is that a user/password of vagrant/vagrant exists on the machine. This user should allow password-less logins with the well known [RSA key made available by HashiCorp](https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/tree/master/keys). Though this may sound like a security risk, remember the purpose of Vagrant and Boxes. They are used locally on the developers workstation. This is a known, secure environment where the ease of use of this setup is important. Using Vagrant with these boxes for a production configuration would be a bad idea.
    1. Run `sh run int mgmt 0` to view the configuration on the management interface. You will see that it is setup to retrieve it's IP address via DHCP. This allows for multiple instances of this box to be used in an environment without IP conflicts. Because the default behavior for management access with Vagrant is NAT, Vagrant commands like `vagrant ssh` work without the developer needing explicit knowledge of the management address.

        ```
        n9kv1# sh run int mgmt 0

        !Command: show running-config interface mgmt0
        !Time: Tue Feb 13 19:56:06 2018

        version 7.0(3)I6(1)

        interface mgmt0
          ip address dhcp
          vrf member management
        ```

    1. Run `sh run | inc feature` to see that NX-API has already been enabled within the box. This means that we can immediately make NX-API connections to this box.

        ```bash
        n9kv1# sh run | inc feature
        feature nxapi
        ```

1. Exit out of the n9000v with `exit` to return to your local terminal.

```bash
n9kv1# exit
Connection to 127.0.0.1 closed.
[root@devbox lab01]#
```

1. Let's verify that the NX-API connection is actually working by sending a JSON-RPC request with `curl`.

    ```bash
    [root@devbox lab01]# curl -X POST \
       -u vagrant:vagrant \
       http://127.0.0.1:2224/ins \
       -H 'Content-Type: application/json-rpc' \

       }
     ]'
    ```

    1. You can also test by opening a web browser to `http://127.0.0.1:2224` to view the NX-API Sandbox. *Credentials are vagrant/vagrant*
