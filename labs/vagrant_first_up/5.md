## Step 5: Destroying the Environment

1. As you learned in the first lab in this module, Vagrant includes a robust set of commands for managing the status of an environment. These allow you to suspend, resume, halt, and destroy your environment. 

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `vagrant up` | Start an environment |
| `vagrant halt` | Shutdown an environment. Not deleted. |
| `vagrant destroy` | Completely delete an environment. |
| `vagrant suspend` | Pause a running environment. |
| `vagrant resume` | Restart a running environment. |
| `vagrant status` | View the current status of the vagrant environment for the local directory. |
| `vagrant global-status` | View the status of any created environments. |

1. When you are finished exploring the environment and commands, destroy this environment with `vagrant destroy`. 

    ```bash
    [root@devbox lab01]# vagrant destroy
        default: Are you sure you want to destroy the 'default' VM? [y/N] y
    ==> default: Forcing shutdown of VM...
    ==> default: Destroying VM and associated drives...
    ```
