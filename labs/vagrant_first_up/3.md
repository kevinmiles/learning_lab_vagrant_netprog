## Step 3: Starting the Vagrant Environment

1. With the Vagrantfile updated, enter `vagrant up` to start your environment.

    ```bash
    [root@devbox lab01]# vagrant up
    ```

1. ***Note: Due to the nature of the Nexus 9000v shell, vagrant will report an error after starting the VM. This is expected, and does not indicate a problem. Simply enter `vagrant up` again to complete the setup successfully.***

    ```bash
    # Output from initial `vagrant up`
    [root@devbox lab01]# vagrant up

    The configured shell (config.ssh.shell) is invalid and unable    <--- Known Error

    # Second `vagrant up`
    [root@devbox lab01]# vagrant up
    Bringing machine 'default' up with 'virtualbox' provider...

    ==> default: Machine 'default' has a post `vagrant up` message. This is a message
    ==> default: from the creator of the Vagrantfile, and not from Vagrant itself:
    ==> default:

    ==> default:     To connect to connect via ssh, use: 'vagrant ssh'.
    ==> default:     To leverage to NETCONF or RESTCONF agent, use:
    ==> default:     'vagrant port' (vagrant version > 1.8)
