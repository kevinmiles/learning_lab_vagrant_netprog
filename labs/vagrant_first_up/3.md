## Step 3: Starting the Vagrant Environment

1. With the Vagrantfile updated, enter `vagrant up` to start your environment.

    ```bash
    [root@devbox lab01]# vagrant up
    ```

1. ***Note: Due to the nature of the Nexus 9000v shell, vagrant will report an error after starting the VM. This is expected, and does not indicate a problem. Simply enter `vagrant up` again to complete the setup successfully.***

    ```bash
    # Output from initial `vagrant up`
    [root@devbox lab01]# vagrant up

    The configured shell (config.ssh.shell) is invalid and unable    <--- Known Error
    to properly execute commands. The most common cause for this is  <---
    using a shell that is unavailable on the system. Please verify   <---
    you're using the full path to the shell and that the shell is    <---

    # Second `vagrant up`
    [root@devbox lab01]# vagrant up
    ```
