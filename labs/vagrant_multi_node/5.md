## Step 5: Destroying the Environment

1. You can use `vagrant destroy` to destroy the entire environment, or `vagrant destroy <NAME>` to destroy individual devices. 

    ```bash
    [root@devbox lab02]# vagrant destroy

        nxos2: Are you sure you want to destroy the 'nxos2' VM? [y/N] y
    ==> nxos2: Forcing shutdown of VM...
    ==> nxos2: Destroying VM and associated drives...
        nxos1: Are you sure you want to destroy the 'nxos1' VM? [y/N] y
    ==> nxos1: Forcing shutdown of VM...
    ==> nxos1: Destroying VM and associated drives...
    ```

1. Re-run `free -m` to view the available memory to verify the usage was due to the vagrant environment. 

    ```bash
    [root@devbox lab02]# free -m
                  total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
    Mem:          11854        1785        7886          43        2182        9581
    Swap:          6015           0        6015
    ```
