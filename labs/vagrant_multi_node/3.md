## Step 3: Exploring the Environment

1. With the environment fully up check the status with `vagrant status`.

    ```bash
    [root@devbox lab02]# vagrant status
    Current machine states:

    nxos1                     running (virtualbox)
    nxos2                     running (virtualbox)

    This environment represents multiple VMs. The VMs are all listed
    above with their current state. For more information about a specific
    VM, run `vagrant status NAME`.
    ```

1. Notice the two VMs listed with the names `nxos1` and `nxos2`. If you recall previously our VMs were called `default`. Here we have overridden the default name of `default` to specify our own names. 
2. Because you have more than one VM in the environment, commands such as `vagrant ssh` require the specification of a name to indicate the target. 

    ```bash
    [root@devbox lab02]# vagrant ssh nxos1

    Bad terminal type: "xterm-256color". Will assume vt100.

    Connection to 127.0.0.1 closed.
    [root@devbox lab02]#
    ```

1. Check the port mappings for nxos2 with `vagrant port nxos2`.

    ```bash
    [root@devbox lab02]# vagrant port nxos2
    The forwarded ports for the machine are listed below. Please note that
    these values may differ from values configured in the Vagrantfile if the
    provider supports automatic port collision detection and resolution.

        80 (guest) => 3280 (host)
       443 (guest) => 3243 (host)
       830 (guest) => 3230 (host)
       443 (guest) => 2200 (host)
        22 (guest) => 3222 (host)
    ```

> Note: Be aware that data plane issues on Ethernet ports have been observed with n9000v on VirtualBox. This means that while you can configure L2 or L3 adjacencies and configuration between a n9000v VM and other VMs using the "link2" style configurations, do not be surprised if you are unable to pass traffic between the interfaces. 
>
> IOS XE and IOS XR images on VirtualBox **do** provide a functional data plane however.
