## Step 2: Starting the Multi-Node Environment

1. Start the environment with `vagrant up`.
    1. ***Note: Due to the nature of the Nexus 9000v shell, Vagrant reports an error after starting each VM. This is expected, and does not indicate a problem. Simply enter `vagrant up` again to complete the setup successfully. For this exercise you'll need to enter `vagrant up` a total of three times.***

    ```bash
    [root@devbox lab02]# vagrant up
    Bringing machine 'nxos1' up with 'virtualbox' provider...
    Bringing machine 'nxos2' up with 'virtualbox' provider...
    .
    .
    The configured shell (config.ssh.shell) is invalid and unable    <-- Expected error
    to properly execute commands. The most common cause for this is
    using a shell that is unavailable on the system. Please verify
    you're using the full path to the shell and that the shell is
    executable by the SSH user.

    # 2nd `vagrant up` after 1st error
    [root@devbox lab02]# vagrant up
    Bringing machine 'nxos1' up with 'virtualbox' provider...
    Bringing machine 'nxos2' up with 'virtualbox' provider...
    ==> nxos1: Machine already provisioned. Run `vagrant provision` or use the `--provision`
    ==> nxos1: flag to force provisioning. Provisioners marked to run always will still run.
    ==> nxos2: Importing base box 'nxos/7.0.3.I6.1'...
    .
    .
    The configured shell (config.ssh.shell) is invalid and unable    <-- Expected error

    # 3rd `vagrant up` after 2nd error
