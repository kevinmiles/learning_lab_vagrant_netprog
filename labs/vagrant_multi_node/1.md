# Multi-Node Vagrant Environments

In this lab you'll see how you can create environments with Vagrant that contain multiple network devices.  

## Objectives

The objective of this lab is to:

* Learn how to create a Vagrantfile for a multi-node environment
* Starting and exploring a multi-node environment
* Destroying your environment when complete.  

## Prerequisites

In order to complete this lab you will need a development workstation with Vagrant and other tools installed.  

The recommendation is to leverage the [DevBox DevNet Sandbox](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/f1a51f3b-3377-444d-97f0-5ad300d976be?diagramType=Topology) which has all the pre-requisites installed and ready to go so you can immediately begin the lab.  

As an alternative you can leverage your own workstation for the lab, but you'll need to follow the steps listed in the "***Setup your own computer***" information at the top of the lab.  

### Using the DevBox Sandbox

1. Reserve an instance of the Sandbox by clicking navigating the [DevBox Sandbox](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/f1a51f3b-3377-444d-97f0-5ad300d976be?diagramType=Topology) page.  Because some of the labs in this module build upon earlier labs, you should reserve your sandbox for long enough that you'll be able to complete all labs in this module.  
1. Once your Sandbox is fully provisioned you'll be sent an email with the VPN credentials to connect to your sandbox.  Connect to your environment using either AnyConnect or OpenConnect.  
1. You can leverage either SSH or RDP to connect to the DevBox at the address of 10.10.20.20 with credentials of root/cisco123.  

### Your Own Workstation

1. Click the link at the top of the page for "Setup your own computer".
1. Follow the setup details to install and configure all the prerequisites needed for the labs in this module.  

### Learning Labs to Complete First

It is recommended that you complete the labs in this module in order.  Before beginning this lab please complete:

* Vagrant 101
* Creating Cisco Network Device Vagrant Boxes
  * **Note: This lab requires that you have already downloaded and added a Vagrant Box for a Nexus 9000v as detailed in this lab.**  
* Your first `vagrant up` of a Network Device

## Environment Clean-Up Check

Before beginning this lab, let's make sure you don't have any Vagrant environments still running from previous labs or steps.  

1. Run `vagrant global-status` to view the status of any active environments.  

    ```bash
    [root@devbox coding]# vagrant global-status

    id       name    provider   state   directory
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    8d1eaec  default virtualbox saved   /root/coding/learning_lab_vagrant_netprog_code/lab01
    91eae66  default virtualbox running /root/coding/learning_lab_vagrant_netprog_code/lab02
    ```

1. If you have any environments listed as `running`, you should either `suspend` or `destroy` them before continuing.  You need to provide the `id` field following the command to indicate which environment you are targeting.  For example:

    ```bash
    # To suspend an environment
    [root@devbox coding]# vagrant suspend 91eae66

    # To Destroy an environment
    [root@devbox coding]# vagrant destroy 91eae66
    ```

    * *Note: You only need to provide enough characters in the ID field to uniquely identify an environment.*

## Step 1: Multi-Node Vagrantfiles

1. You should have already cloned down the code sample repository for these labs in the previous learning lab, but if you happened to skip that lab, here are the steps again.  

    ```bash
    [root@devbox box_building]# cd ~
    [root@devbox ~]# cd coding/
    [root@devbox coding]# git clone https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/learning_lab_vagrant_netprog_code

    Cloning into 'learning_lab_vagrant_netprog_code'...
    remote: Counting objects: 3, done.
    remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 3 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
    Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.

    [root@devbox coding]# cd learning_lab_vagrant_netprog_code/

    [root@devbox learning_lab_vagrant_netprog_code]# ls
    lab01  lab02  lab03  README.md
    ```

1. Enter the `lab02` directory.  

    ```bash
    [root@devbox learning_lab_vagrant_netprog_code]# cd lab02
    ```

1. Open the Vagrantfile with vim to view it's contents.  If you are unfamiliar with vim that is fine.  We are leveraging it simply to view the file with color syntax highlighting.  (Though the syntax highlighting is missing from the learning lab view below.)

    ```bash
    [root@devbox lab02]# vim Vagrantfile
    ```

    1. Navigate up and down the file within vim by using the `j` key to move down a line, and `k` key to move up a line.  Quit and exit vim by pressing the `:` key and enter `q!` followed by pressing **Enter**.

1. This Vagrantfile does not include any of the default comments that you saw in the previous exercises, but rather only has the active configuration and relevant comments.  

    ```ruby
    # -*- mode: ruby -*-
    # vi: set ft=ruby :

    Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
        config.vm.define "nxos1" do |node|
            node.vm.box =  "nxos/7.0.3.I7.3"

            config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
              vb.memory = "4096"
              vb.customize ['modifyvm', :id, '--uart1', '0x3F8', 4, '--uartmode1', 'disconnected']
              vb.customize ['modifyvm', :id, '--uart2', '0x2F8', 3, '--uartmode2', 'disconnected']
            end

            # eth1/1 connected to link2,
            node.vm.network :private_network, virtualbox__intnet: "link2", auto_config: false

            # Explicity set SSH Port to avoid conflict and for provisioning
            config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 22, host: 3122, id: 'ssh', auto_correct: true

            # Forward API Ports
            config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 80, host: 3180, id: 'http', auto_correct: true
            config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 443, host: 3143, id: 'https', auto_correct: true
            config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 830, host: 3130, id: 'netconf', auto_correct: true
        end

        config.vm.define "nxos2" do |node|
            node.vm.box =  "nxos/7.0.3.I7.3"

            config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
              vb.memory = "4096"
              vb.customize ['modifyvm', :id, '--uart1', '0x3F8', 4, '--uartmode1', 'disconnected']
              vb.customize ['modifyvm', :id, '--uart2', '0x2F8', 3, '--uartmode2', 'disconnected']
            end

            # eth1/1 connected to link2,
            node.vm.network :private_network, virtualbox__intnet: "link2", auto_config: false

            # Explicity set SSH Port to avoid conflict and for provisioning
            config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 22, host: 3222, id: 'ssh', auto_correct: true

            # Forward API Ports
            config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 80, host: 3280, id: 'http', auto_correct: true
            config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 443, host: 3243, id: 'https', auto_correct: true
            config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 830, host: 3230, id: 'netconf', auto_correct: true
        end

    end
    ```

    1. Notice that there are two `config.vm.define` blocks.  Each block identifies a separate VM to be provisioned.  
    2. Both VMs leverage the exact same box as a starting point
    3. Each n9000v switch has their "Ethernet1/1" interface connected to the virtual network "link2" with the following line.  This achieves the equivalent of connecting the two interfaces via a "virtual cable" that we are calling "link2"

        ```ruby
        node.vm.network :private_network, virtualbox__intnet: "link2", auto_config: false
        ```    

    4. Within the Vagrantfile we are explicitly mapping ports 22, 80, 443, and 830 to host ports with "31xx" for nxos1 and "32xx" for nxos2.  Vagrant will automatically resolve port conflicts if we didn't take this step, however the ports selected maybe random and not what we expected.

#### Next Step: Starting the Multi-Node Environment
