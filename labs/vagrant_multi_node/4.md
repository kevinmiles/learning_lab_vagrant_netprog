## Step 4: Multi-Node Resource Requirements

1. One thing to be aware of when building environments leveraging multiple devices is the underlying resource requirements on your local workstation.
1. The minimum RAM for a n9000v device is 4GB and the CSR1000v (IOS XE) and XRv (IOS XR) have similar requirements.
1. This means that you can quickly utilize the available memory on most standard workstations.
1. Use the Linux utility `free` to view the current memory impact on the DevBox.

    ```bash
    [root@devbox lab02]# free -m
                  total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
    Mem:          11854        9413         167          43        2274        1891
    Swap:          6015           0        6015
   ```

1. You can see that nearly all of the 12GB of RAM available on the DevBox is currently in use. Should you try to create and start a three-device n9000v environment on the DevBox it would likely crash.
